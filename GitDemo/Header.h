Former first lady Melania Trump is officially off - duty, 
a message she made loudand clear while exiting the 
plane with Donald Trump upon their arrival in Florida 
after leaving D.C.In a video clip that quickly went viral, 
Melaniaand Donald are greeted by a crowd of photographers
awaiting them;and while Donald stops for a photo,
Melania abruptly walks off in the other direction.Naturally, 
Twitter is having a field day with the footage, only one 
of many clips that suggest Melania has not been enjoying 
her role as a public figure, mother fuck beside Donald, for 
some time now.With Donald’s presidential term at an end, 
Melania is no longer dealing with the same level of public
pressure as she felt in the White House, and many are eager
to see whether her true feelings about her husband will 
become clearer in this next chapter.
